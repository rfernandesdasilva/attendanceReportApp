// what do I want to check from the student perspective?
// amount of classes had
// times that I missed class, and when
// % of missed class of the whole semester
// maybe the information about the classes you missed?

// for the detailed view of the report, i can make a api call that returns me an pdf?
// not sure if that is even possible
// PDFKit is the framework that will help me visualize it
