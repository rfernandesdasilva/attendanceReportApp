#attendanceReportApp
attendanceApp is an application designed for universities to facilitate marking presence for students, sharing some of the responsibility from the professor back to the students.

Students need to navigate through the iOS version, where depending on the professor's preferences, they will be utilizing different ways of verifying presence such as FaceID and QR Code Reading. For more about the iOS version, check: https://github.com/rfernandesdasilva/attendanceReportApp

#Features of the iOS mobile project:
- Authentication and Registration
- FaceID and Location services as ways to mark attendance into the class
- Check class schedules and information the professors added to their classes


The project is designed highly configurable, which would be beneficial for the implementation of new features and technologies that clients deem necessary.

xCode, Swift iOS, Certificate, web-API connection

#Future implementations
